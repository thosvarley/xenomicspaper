# Feature Row 1
feature_row1:
  - image_path: /assets/images/milestones/red_green_cdo.png
    alt: #""
    title: "1. Computer-designed organisms."
    excerpt: "By combining AI design methods with a cell-based construction toolkit, a scalable pipeline for designing and creating novel organisms is introduced."

# Feature Row 2
feature_row2:
  - image_path: /assets/images/milestones/living_robot_swarm.jpg
    alt: #""
    title: "2. Living robot swarms"
    excerpt: "New motors, sensors, and faster manufacture enable living robot swarms. By training xenobots to self-organize into multi-agent swarms, they can accomplish tasks no single bot could alone."

# Feature row 4
feature_row4:
  - image_path: /assets/images/milestones/xenomics.png
    alt: #""
    title: "4. Xenomics: a toolkit to study xenobots."
    excerpt: "Combining methodologies from computational neuroscience, developmental biology, and information theory, xenomics is a new toolkit for scientists interested in understanding the internal structure of xenobots."
